# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


# Overview of Project
Pewlett-Hackard is a well established company with thousands of employees. Its leadership needs help to prepare for the upcoming silver tsunami. Using SQL Postgres, I create a database from 6 of their CSV files. Thereafter, I analyse Pewlett-Hackard's records in terms of mentorship eligibility and retirement eligibility to help management prepare for, source and better understand their workforce.   


# Results

 * Below is a summary of the top 5 employees who by the most recent job title, are about to retire.

 * Senior Engineers are most eligible for retirement. I would advise HR to amp up their hiring of software engineers to fill up upcoming vacant positions.

# Summary
From the analysis;

1. 41,380 roles will need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins to make an impact. 
2. There are more than enough retirement-ready employees (41,380) in the departments to mentor the  next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees (1549).
